# sane-twitter
Twitter's new design is different, and some of us don't like it. 
Some question whether it's an improvement over the previous version.
Well, no matter, you can have your old Twitter back. With 12 lines of code.
(not counting the manifest. Would count as 1 line if you removed all newlines, which would also be valid, honestly)
